Hello, My name is John Patlakas and I am aspiring for a career in Data Science. I am a recent graduate of the Data Science diploma program at BrainStation where I learned programming languages such as SQL and Python. We were then able to implement our core foundation of Python into machine learning models. I have taken all the skills I have learned in this intense program and created this capstone project.  
### More Information

My Capstone project is a salary arbitration model that is designed to predict the salary of a given player.
